					"My name is Belly Allen, and I am the fattest man alive. When I was a child, I saw my mother killed by something obese. My father went to prison for her murder. Then my unhealthy diet made me obese. To the outside world, I'm just an ordinary basement dweller, but secretly, with the help of my friends at Big Belly Burger, I use my obesity to eat food and find other sacks of overweight shit like me. After defeating Womb and saving the Big Belly Burger Central City chain, I became a black hole due to my density and went back in time, creating the alternate timeline "Fleshpoint". I restored the timeline to how it was, only things weren't as I left them. I brought new food into our world, and I'm the only one fat enough to eat them.

					I am the Flesh."
